  Glenn Miller Café is both the smallest and largest jazz club. We are proud and
  grateful to be able to offer you a high quality and great variety of jazz and
  jazz musicians.


  The cuisine is French with dishes such as Confit de Canard, six different varieties of Moules Frites, Creme Brulée etc. If you want to eat, it is good to book a table. If you do not want to eat, you are welcome to the bar area where you can have something to drink and listen to the concert, - if there is room of course since the place is very small. 


  Please note that we are first and foremost a jazz club. In order to respect the music and the musicians, we ask you to save the conversations for the breaks during the concert.
